- Example: `@bot what's the average SaaS valuation multiple?`

#### **Trigger Automatic Responses:**
The bot will automatically respond when you discuss:
- **Investment topics**: valuation, market size, revenue, growth
- **Questions**: Any message ending with `?`
- **Fact-checking**: When numbers or claims are mentioned
- **Topic drift**: If conversation goes off-topic

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is busy, the server will show an error. Try:
```bash
# Kill any process using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Or change the port in src/web-server.ts (line 15)
```

### Connection Issues
- Make sure the server is running (you should see "Web chat server running...")
- Check that your firewall isn't blocking port 3000
- Try refreshing the browser page

### Bot Not Responding
- The bot uses simulated responses for the demo
- Try using trigger words: valuation, market, revenue, @bot
- Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
