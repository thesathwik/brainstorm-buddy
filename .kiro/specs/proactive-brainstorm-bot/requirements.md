# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a proactive AI bot for VC boardroom brainstorming sessions. Unlike traditional reactive chatbots that only respond when explicitly summoned, this bot intelligently monitors conversations and intervenes when it can add value. The bot uses the Gemini API as its base model and focuses on keeping discussions on track, providing relevant information, and enhancing collaborative decision-making in venture capital contexts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a VC partner, I want the bot to automatically detect when our discussion is going off-topic, so that we can stay focused on investment decisions and maximize meeting productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the conversation diverges from investment-related topics for more than 2 consecutive messages THEN the bot SHALL politely redirect the conversation back to the main agenda
2. WHEN participants discuss topics unrelated to the current deal or investment theme THEN the bot SHALL suggest returning to the core discussion points
3. WHEN the bot intervenes for topic redirection THEN it SHALL provide a brief summary of what was being discussed before the divergence
4. WHEN detecting topic drift THEN the bot SHALL intervene proactively without waiting to be summoned
5. WHEN redirecting conversation THEN the bot SHALL use professional, natural language that maintains meeting flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a VC team member, I want the bot to proactively provide relevant market data or company information during discussions, so that I don't need to leave the chat to research details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN participants mention a company name or market sector THEN the bot SHALL automatically provide relevant financial metrics, recent news, or market trends
2. WHEN investment terms or valuations are discussed THEN the bot SHALL offer comparable market data or industry benchmarks
3. WHEN the bot provides information THEN it SHALL cite sources and indicate data freshness
4. IF the information is not readily available THEN the bot SHALL acknowledge the limitation and suggest where to find it

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a VC analyst, I want the bot to recognize when someone needs validation or fact-checking, so that decisions are based on accurate information without interrupting the flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN participants make claims about market size, growth rates, or competitive landscape THEN the bot SHALL proactively verify and provide supporting or contradicting data
2. WHEN uncertainty is expressed through phrases like "I think" or "maybe" regarding factual matters THEN the bot SHALL offer to provide clarification
3. WHEN conflicting information is presented by different participants THEN the bot SHALL help resolve discrepancies with authoritative sources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a meeting facilitator, I want the bot to understand conversation context and timing, so that it only intervenes when truly helpful rather than being disruptive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN participants are in deep discussion or debate THEN the bot SHALL wait for natural pauses before interjecting
2. WHEN the bot has been silent for an extended period AND has relevant input THEN it SHALL find an appropriate moment to contribute
3. WHEN participants explicitly ask the bot to be quiet or less active THEN it SHALL reduce intervention frequency accordingly
4. WHEN the conversation is flowing productively THEN the bot SHALL remain silent even if it has relevant information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a VC team member, I want to be able to summon the bot for specific help while maintaining its proactive capabilities, so that I have control when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a participant mentions the bot by name or uses a trigger phrase THEN the bot SHALL respond immediately regardless of its proactive assessment
2. WHEN summoned with a clear question or request THEN the bot SHALL respond directly without asking "what do you need" or echoing the user's words
3. WHEN providing summoned assistance THEN the bot SHALL return to proactive monitoring mode afterward
4. WHEN responding to summons THEN the bot SHALL use natural, professional language without robotic phrases like "Based on your question about..."

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a VC team member, I want the bot to communicate in a professional, natural manner that enhances rather than disrupts our business discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN responding to any query THEN the bot SHALL use professional business language appropriate for executive-level discussions
2. WHEN providing information THEN the bot SHALL avoid robotic phrases like "Based on your question about..." or echoing user words verbatim
3. WHEN intervening proactively THEN the bot SHALL use confident, direct language that adds value to the conversation
4. WHEN uncertain about information THEN the bot SHALL acknowledge limitations professionally without undermining its credibility
5. WHEN redirecting topics THEN the bot SHALL use diplomatic language that maintains positive group dynamics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the bot to learn from conversation patterns and feedback, so that its proactive interventions become more accurate and valuable over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN participants react positively to bot interventions THEN the system SHALL record this as successful proactive behavior
2. WHEN participants ignore or dismiss bot contributions THEN the system SHALL adjust its intervention thresholds
3. WHEN the bot receives explicit feedback about its behavior THEN it SHALL incorporate this into future decision-making
4. WHEN similar conversation patterns occur THEN the bot SHALL apply learned preferences from previous sessions
