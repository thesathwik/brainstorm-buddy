# What This Application Does

This is an AI-powered brainstorming chat application that acts like a smart meeting participant. It silently monitors conversations and only speaks up when it can add real value - answering direct questions (@bot), providing relevant data when gaps are detected, or gently redirecting when discussions drift off-topic to personal matters.

Unlike typical chatbots that respond to every message, this bot understands context and timing. It maintains a professional VC analyst tone, offering punchy insights rather than verbose explanations. Perfect for investment discussions, strategy sessions, or any collaborative brainstorming where you want AI assistance without constant interruption.
